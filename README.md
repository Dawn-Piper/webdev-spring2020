# Guidelines from the assignment:
*  Think carefully about the use of layout tags such as tables, and only use them where content is really a table. 
*  Make sure that all the parts of the pages have a semantic identity, either by using existing semantic tags or by 
defining "div" tags for the content. 
*  Attempt to use a range of the various formatting tags available to add richness and extra meaning to your content. 
*  Consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information.
    
### Step 1: 
Markup Wireframes with HTML (Consider how your HTML supports the use of your pages by users with disabilities.)
### Step 2: 
Code the three pages in HTML and enter in some essential text content that you write yourself
*  Name the main/first page of your web site: index.html. Ensure that you use comments to help all the coders to 
   understand the code.
*  Find some pictures and any other media that you consider appropriate and embed them into the pages using the 
   correct HTML tags. 
*  Ensure that your code includes comments to help you work with the code and quickly relate it to the wireframes.
*  It could be helpful to include comments to indicate who contributed chunks of the code so that you can ensure 
   you can work together as a team.
### Step 3: 
   Validate the code in the pages: https://validator.w3.org/
   
## Review Criteria
We are looking for a well constructed skeleton that reflects the design in the wireframes and for content that is relevant and appropriate.

#### Marks will be awarded for the following:

*  Does the URL lead to the correct website?
*  Appropriate semantic tags used, both the predefined tags and the appropriate use of div block tags.
*  The range of different layout, formatting and media HTML tags used and their appropriate use (eg tables used as tables not for layout)
*  Rich comments
*  Accessibility, particularly in the use of the media tags. 
*  Tidy directory structure

Should we say aim for ten tags each?
