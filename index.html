<!--Overall Guidelines
    * Think carefully about the use of layout tags such as tables, and only use them where content is really a table. 
    * Make sure that all the parts of the pages have a semantic identity, either by using existing semantic tags or by 
    defining "div" tags for the content. 
    * Attempt to use a range of the various formatting tags available to add richness and extra meaning to your content. 
    * Consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information.
    
    Step 1: Markup Wireframes with HTML (Consider how your HTML supports the use of your pages by users with disabilities.)
    Step 2: Code the three pages in HTML and enter in some essential text content that you write yourself
            * Name the main/first page of your web site: index.html. Ensure that you use comments to help all the coders to 
            understand the code.
            * Find some pictures and any other media that you consider appropriate and embed them into the pages using the 
            correct HTML tags. 
            * Ensure that your code includes comments to help you work with the code and quickly relate it to the wireframes.
            * It could be helpful to include comments to indicate who contributed chunks of the code so that you can ensure 
            you can work together as a team.
    Step 3: Validate the code in the pages: https://validator.w3.org/
